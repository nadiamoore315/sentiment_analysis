# Sentimental Analysis

## Background
This script is intended to read in reviews and assign them a score based on
how positive a review is. The higher the score, the more positive. It's currently
set at a scale of 1 to 5.

## History/Updates
[Original script](https://github.com/nadiamoore315/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/sentimental_analysis.py): takes a specific store's reviews off of yelp and assigns them 

[Updated script](https://github.com/nadiamoore315/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/sentimental_analysis_updated.py): allows user to specify which yelp website to analyze and also provides an average of the sentimental analysis

## Future Version Ideas
Future versions of this can include making the script more user-friendly,
with the website being able to be provided by a user through the terminal,
rather than directly having to edit the script.

Another version of this script can be for detecting comments that go
against policy guidelines and to gauge audience interest/disinterest
for particular businesses, goods, services, etc.
